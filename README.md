# MiWatch_DataViewer
Repository of the program to see the data collected by the Mi Watch (via Mi Fitness app) with metrics and machine learning

The objective is creating a useful small library to allow for a better visualization of the data gathered by the smartwatch than the one given by the Mi fitness app

The Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file is where I try stuff out
The Python (.py) file is where I save the stuff that works
